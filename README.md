# Patient Dashboard System

## Theoretical Overview

### System Architecture
This application follows a **3-tier architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer**: React-based frontend handling UI/UX
2. **Application Layer**: Express.js backend serving REST APIs
3. **Data Layer**: File-based storage (JSON) simulating database functionality

The architecture implements the **Client-Server model** with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.

### Authentication Mechanism
The system implements a **session-less authentication** approach using:
- Basic credential validation against stored user data
- Client-side session persistence via localStorage
- Mock authentication flow that simulates real-world security practices

### Data Management
The solution employs a **file-based data persistence** model that:
- Uses Node.js filesystem (fs) module for CRUD operations
- Stores data in JSON format for human readability
- Implements data encapsulation through service modules
- Maintains relational integrity through user IDs

### Frontend Design Principles
The interface follows **modern React patterns**:
- Component-based architecture
- Hook-based state management
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Chart visualization for data representation
- Form handling with validation

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functionalities

#### Weight Tracking Module
- Implements time-series data storage
- Visualizes progress using linear regression charts
- Supports manual data entry with date selection
- Calculates derived metrics (BMI, progress percentage)

#### Medication Management
- Tracks shipment lifecycle (preparing → shipped → delivered)
- Stores prescription details (medication type, dosage)
- Manages delivery timelines and tracking

### Technical Specifications

**Frontend Stack:**
- Framework: React 18
- State Management: Context API + useReducer
- Charting: Chart.js
- Routing: React Router v6
- Styling: CSS Modules

**Backend Stack:**
- Runtime: Node.js
- Framework: Express.js
- Data Storage: JSON file system
- API Design: RESTful principles

## Development Guidelines

### Component Architecture
The frontend follows **atomic design principles**:
- Pages: Top-level route components
- Templates: Reusable layout structures
- Organisms: Complex UI components
- Molecules: Simple component groups
- Atoms: Basic UI elements

### State Management
The application uses:
- Local state for UI-specific data
- Context API for global state
- Server state for persistent data
- Derived state for calculated values

## Quality Attributes

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on all forms
- Client-side route protection
- Mock authentication flow
- Data sanitization before storage

### Performance Characteristics
- Frontend code splitting
- Efficient data fetching patterns
- Chart optimization techniques
- Responsive image handling

### Maintainability
- Clear component boundaries
- Consistent coding style
- Modular architecture
- Comprehensive documentation

## Theoretical Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. File-based storage constraints:
   - No concurrent write protection
   - Limited query capabilities
   - Scalability challenges

2. Authentication:
   - Plain text credential storage (for demo only)
   - No password encryption
   - Basic session management

### Recommended Improvements
For production deployment:
1. Implement proper database system
2. Add password hashing
3. Introduce API security layers
4. Add input sanitization
5. Implement proper error handling

This theoretical foundation supports the practical implementation while clearly documenting the system's design decisions and technical approach. 
The architecture balances simplicity for demonstration purposes with patterns that would scale to production requirements.
